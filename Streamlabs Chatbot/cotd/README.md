# Installation and Customization Instructions

Hello!
This command was designed to generate a customizable message for Trackmania's Cup of the Day, with information about track author, name, author time, and much more. 

## Installing and Configuring Python 2.7
If you don't have python 2.7 installed on your computer, or have never used a custom script with Streamlabs Chatbot, I recommend following the instructions on [this link](https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/chatbot-scripts-desktop) for details on how to install and configure python 2.7 for Streamlabs. 


Once this is done, follow the steps below to add the command to your streamlabs chatbot: 

## Installing the Script
1. [Download the cotd.zip file](https://github.com/MilkySalamander/Commands/raw/main/Streamlabs%20Chatbot/cotd/cotd.zip) 
2. Go to the 'Scripts' tab in streamlabs chatbot and click the 'Import' button in the top right.
3. Navigate to the .zip file downloaded earlier and select it
5. Click the 'Reload Scripts' button in the top right, and check the box on the far right to enable the cotd script

## Customize the Command

The command comes loaded with a default message for ease of use, but certain aspects can be customized by clicking on the command in the scripts tab.
Here, you can specify the cooldown of the command (in seconds), and the message to display to the user before, or during the cup of the day.

You will see the default messages in both the 'Displayed Message (during COTD)' and 'Displayed Message (before COTD)' boxes, and they are formatted like this:

```
Some text to display literally {variableName} some more text to display {anotherVariable}
```

**To create your own custom message, you can type any text you would like to appear in the message, but any variables (information that changes with each COTD) must be surrounded in curly brackets: {}**

### Variable Names and Contents
A list of the available variable names and their contents for your convenience:
Variable Name | Example | Description
--------------|---------|------------
{trackName} | MIXTA VIA | The name of the track of the day
{authorName} | Erizel  | The name of the author of the track
{trackTMXLink} | https://trackmania.exchange/maps/26727  | The tmx link to the track of the day (returns "Track not found on TMX" if no link can be found)
